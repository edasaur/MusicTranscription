MusicTranscription
==================

Started at CalHacks 2014. Aim is to convert audio data into sheet music.

Goals:
- [x] ~~Figure out how to read the audio file~~
- [ ] Figure out how FFTs work from fftw.org and use them
- [ ] Read output data from FFTs and attempt note conversion
- [ ] Also perform rhythm recognition
- [x] Output into music sheet as PDF using lilypond.
- [ ] Make into a web application much like many youtube to mp3 services.


Update:
Outputting music sheet is taken care of.
Python program can output an accurate sheet for basic scales, but is not at all accurate when given more complex music.
